Multi-class hand shape detection using binary classifiers. Final project for CS532 at UW-Madison.

Note: To run keypoint detection, [download the caffe model here](http://posefs1.perception.cs.cmu.edu/OpenPose/models/hand/pose_iter_102000.caffemodel) and put in a folder named "hand-model" at the same level as this repository. File tree should be:
